# meditation-timer-plus

A meditation timer/practice app that takes all the features I like into one place

## Planned Features

### Stopwatch/Countdown

Simultaneous stopwatch and countdown, so that if you decide to go over your end planned time you can tell how long your full session was
Program an order into countdown
e.g. 5min -> 5min -> 5min -> 30 min, etc
Enable user control of queue
Play bell/gong at each countdown timer finish
Change volume on gong, override device volume setting

### Don't distract, be reliable

Option to turn on Do Not Disturb
Option to silence ringer
Make run with screen off

## Possible future features, in no particular order

Changeable sound
A dial for the countdown?
Quick cheatsheet/cliffnotes of different styles of practice
e.g. TMI, MCTB, Kasina, Metta/loving-kindness, Brahmavihara, etc
Kasina images
Adjustable brightness
Upload your own manually
Countdown with gong every X minutes for either total time or Y number of iterations
Play sound every X minutes outside of formal sitting (toggleable)
Option to mute at:
certain times

Input mp3 track for guided meditations
Built in set of free to use ones maybe?
